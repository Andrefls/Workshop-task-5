# Just a task to Learn something new

## Synopsis

- When I started working on this workshop task, I didn’t have a clear idea of what to do. Everything related to data is very new to me, including using a spreadsheet. From the beginning, I felt that something wasn't right.

- After clarifying my thoughts, I decided to approach the task by using the provided example as a learning opportunity regarding data. I planned to tweak a few details to make it work.

- This time, it wasn’t about being creative; it was about learning something new that would help me implement better ways of doing things in the future.

## Summary/Problem-solving

- As usual, I began by following the examples from our lecture. 

- I first watched our lecture video at 

https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/121821/pages/week-1-overview?module_item_id=2435967. 

- After that, I spent a significant amount of time thinking about how to represent the data in the table. Once I had a workable idea, I started typing the data into the spreadsheet. 

- The data is related to how many stationary elements I spend throughout the year while doing my drawings. 

- To enhance my work, I visited several online pages to find image resources:

- After collecting the images, I used Photoshop to modify them and apply transparencies.

- However, when I followed the example from our lecture, my example didn't work.

- I tried numerous solutions and even asked AI (Meta) what might be wrong with my code.

- <img width="253" alt="Ai q" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1379ad9b-ddd8-4e2f-934d-0cd2ddfdafa8" />

- Meta provided a long code response and mentioned that my code was missing some functions.

- I hesitated to make those changes because I found it hard to believe that the example from the lecture was also missing something, especially since it was working.

- So, I approached the lecturer instead for help. He pointed out that a capital letter in my code was preventing the formula from working correctly. 

- After fixing that issue, it was simply a matter of duplicating the function for the other images. 

- I also experimented with colours, canvas sizes, and distances to make everything fit well. After a long day of troubleshooting, I finally succeeded.

## Future development

- I would love to learn how to represent this data using fluids.

## Conclusion


- I know it's not the prettiest work, but I have learned a few very important things: creating a spreadsheet using my own data, importing it to code, reading that data, and representing it with something.
